## General
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Maybe useful for collaboration, plus free GPU resources
- Basically Jupyter Notebook though

[Weld.rs](https://github.com/weld-project/weld) -- pretty sick compiler/environment for end-to-end parallelization and optimization of data applications, all done at runtime   
[Weld.rs](https://www.weld.rs/)  -- Weld main website, mainly a research project done by grad students at Stanford    
[libxsmm](https://github.com/hfp/libxsmm) -- open source Intel project for small matrix multiplications, deep learning, convolutions, etc. Lots of parallelization and systems-level optimization done to speed up basic operations.
